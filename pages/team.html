                    <p>I've always had a passion for all things engineering – namely building fully autonomous self-driving vehicles. In fact, my passion all started at my condo lounge when my roommate said, "Take racing to the next level... by going autonomous."</p>
                    <p>I replied with "Dope nasty."</p>
                    <p>Four years later, the autonomous racing project is now my PhD research topic under the tuleage of Professor Dennis Hong.
                    Outside of racing with code, I spend a lot of my time playing golf and doing pilates. I'm also married to my lovely wife, Lauren – of whom has always supported my racing passion.</p>
