                <p>I've always had a passion for all things engineering – namely building fully autonomous self-driving vehicles. In fact, my passion all started at my condo lounge when my roommate said, "Take racing to the next level... by going autonomous." I replied with "Dope nasty."</p>

                <p>Four years later, the autonomous racing project is now my PhD research topic under the tuleage of Professor Dennis Hong.</p>

                <p>Outside of racing with code, I spend a lot of my time playing golf and doing pilates. I'm also married to my lovely wife, Lauren – of whom has always supported my racing passion.</p>

For these past two years, I've been an Officer Board of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) at UCLA as an Aircopter Co-Lead during 2020 - 2021, and as R&D Lead during 2021 - 2022.</p>

                <p>I enjoy extending the skills and concepts I've learned in courses in the real world, which is why I've been heavily involved in IEEE throughout my college experience. From Aircopter to Micromouseto Digital Audio Visualizer, I've enjoyed every second of my timewith the IEEE projects offered at UCLA.</p>

                <p>My passion for electrical engineering has also paved the way formy interest in computers as well. Assembling computers, building keyboards, playing video games, coding, you name it. Outside of the house, I love playing and watching just about all sports, namely hockey, football, basketball, and soccer.</p>

                <o>I’ve always had a strong interest in extending the academia I learned beyond the classroom. That’s why I’ve engaged in projects such as examining the accuracy in estimating two ordinary differential equations using the Range Kutta Method.</p>

                <p>While programming has given me many sleepless nights, it has also given rise to my hobby as a barista. In fact, you can find me making up coffee and tea concoctions on the weekends. Beyond that, I’m also passionate in photography – a hobby I hope to make into a side career as a professional.</p>

                <p>Above all, I’m always willing to keep up with the rapidly changing pace of technology by learning something new everyday.</p>
